Big Idea:
-Find the childless nodes
-Find each of their ancestries
-Collect the ancestors that are found in all of the ancestries

Specifics
//Read
-Read header
-Using header indo create hashmap for nodes

//Compute
-Create baseset (from one to N)
-Collect all nodes that are present in the map as parents
-Get the differences of these sets -> set of xhildless nodes

-For each childless node, find its ancestors
	-
-Get their intersection
