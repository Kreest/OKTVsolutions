Let's start with 1 student. That's one permutation. So far so good.
Then, with 2 students, (1 2) is ruled out, leaving only (2 1), so that's still only a single permutation.
These are the base values for the function, all of the following outputs are to be calculated from these.
Let's look at an example. With 3 students we have (3 2 1), (3 1 2), and (1 3 2) as correct permutations. Let's try to get to 4 from that!
Taking (3 2 1), we can insert 4 into 3 places: (4 3 2 1), (3 2 4 1), and (3 2 1 4). So, everywhere except behind the 3.
Then we can do the same for the other two permutations, getting us to 9 permutations for 4.
To generalize, when we want to get the number of correct permutations for n, we can take whatever we got for the number of permutations for n-1, and then add n in n-1 places for each one.
That gets us to (n-1) * perm(n-1) so far.
Okay, back to our example of 4. We have only two more permutations to go!
Let's take a look at them: (2 4 3 1) and (3 1 4 2). The thing these two have in common is that by taking out the 4, we'd get an invalid permutation!
So, how do we get to those? If we look at the permutation for 2, so (1 2), we could absolutely insert a 3 behind a 2, if only we'd put a 4 between them. That's (1 2 4 3).
Then, if we take (2 1) and treat it as (3 1), we could insert a (4 2) behind the 1, getting us (3 1 4 2).
To generalize again, by pairing up our n with all the numbers from 2 to n-1, we can insert that pairing into every permutation of n-2, right behind the number one less than the one we've selected.
That gets us (n-2) * perm(n-2). By adding the two results together, we get that perm(n) = (n-1) * perm(n-1) + (n-2) * perm(n-2). This is the correct formula we were looking for!
